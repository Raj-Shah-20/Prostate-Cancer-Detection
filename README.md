## Problem Definition
<p align = "justify">Computer-based decision-support systems and machine learning (ML) have the potential to revolutionize the
healthcare system by playing advanced tasks that are presently appointed to specialists to enhance diagnostic accuracy, increase the potency of throughputs, improve clinical advancement, decrease human resource
costs and improve treatment decisions. We aim to design a system using AI, which uses information derived
from medical images that help to detect prostate cancer in men that can reduce discrepancies caused due to
traditional tests like PSA, biopsy, and so on.

## Results
<p align = "justify">The result analysis (Table 5.1) shows that without Data Augmentation, Gaussian Naive Bayes and SVM
provided the best result i.e, 85% whereas K-Means has the least result of 25%. With Data Augmentation,
SVM and Random Forest provided the best result with an accuracy of 95% whereas K-Means had the least
result of 67%. Fig 5.7 shows the performance comparison of the models.</p>

## Conclusion
<p align = "justify">Certain patients that are diagnosed with prostate cancer which is thought to be more indolent can continue with repeated forms of surveillance including prostate biopsies, PSA, and other forms of digital testing
through MRI or rectal examinations unless they experience any physiological side effects. AI can help improve these forms of surveillance and will be amongst some of the essential tools to urological pathologists
and to the field of urology as a whole as technology continues to improve and help patient prognosis.
The task done in Semester 6 was Literature Survey in order to learn more about this field. Different datasets
were analysed and the most favourable one was selected. Techniques involved in classification of cancer
were studied and Machine Learning was found to be suitable for our requirements. Different algorithms
like Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gaussian Na¨ıve Bayes, XGBoost, K-Means are
considered for the system. </p>
